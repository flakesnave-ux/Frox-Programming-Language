# Official Announcement: Frox Programming Language

Hello fellow developers,

I am an independent developer, and this is the official announcement for a project I have been working on: **Frox** — a new programming language.

### 🚀 Status
I am committed to releasing a **BETA version** for everyone to experience in the near future. 

### 🛠 Development Progress
As of today, the language consists of **41 core functions** that I have developed independently. These functions form the foundation of the **Flaker Engine** environment.

### 📜 Authorship & Copyright
The purpose of this document is to establish a public record of my authorship and to formally mark me as the creator and "father" of the Frox language.
